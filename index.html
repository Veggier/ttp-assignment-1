      <p>
        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in 
        Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.93 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 357,000 deaths.
        More than 2.38 million people have recovered.
      </p>

    <div class="container-fluid info-article m-5">
      <h2 class="text-danger">Symptoms</h2>
        <hr class="my-1">
      <p>
        Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute 
        respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically 
        around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container-fluid info-article m-5">
      <h2 class="text-danger">Transmission</h2>
        <hr class="my-1">
      <p>
        The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather 
        than travelling through air over long distances. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, 
        although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
        Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.

    <div class="container-fluid info-article m-5">
      <h2 class="text-danger">Prevention</h2>
        <hr class="my-1">
      <p>
        Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away
        from the face.In addition, the use of a face covering is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers. Recommendations for face covering use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending for them, 
        some recommending against them (to conserve masks for healthcare workers), and others requiring their use. There is limited evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community.

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Progressively stronger mitigation efforts to reduce the number of active cases at any given time—"flattening the curve"—allows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients. Likewise, 
              progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity—called raising the line—such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand.</p>

            <p>Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration—such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation</p>
